Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
 It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
  making it over  years old. Richard McClintock, 2000 a Latin professor
   at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more 
   obscure Latin words,

    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
    going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
    discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from 
    sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
     Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, 
     written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the 
     theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
      The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
       amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
